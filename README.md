# User Access Review & Evidence Documentation Project

## Situation
Organizations must regularly review user access to ensure employees only have access
necessary for their job roles. Poor access control increases the risk of data breaches,
insider threats, and audit findings.

As a GRC analyst, I am tasked with reviewing access requests and performing
a periodic user access review while maintaining audit-ready evidence.

## Task
My responsibilities included:
- Reviewing access requests submitted through Jira
- Verifying manager approval before access was granted
- Ensuring access aligned with the principle of least privilege
- Documenting evidence such as screenshots and email approvals
- Structuring documentation by control, system, and review period

---

## Action
I performed the following actions:
- Reviewed Jira access request tickets for completeness and approval
- Validated manager authorization via email evidence
- Conducted a user access review across selected systems
- Documented access decisions and rationale
- Maintained a structured evidence register linking controls, systems, and time periods

---

## Result
This project demonstrates my ability to:
- Perform access request and user access reviews
- Scrutinize approvals and authorization
- Maintain audit-ready evidence
- Document controls clearly and consistently
- Support compliance with access control requirements (ISO 27001, SOC 2, GDPR)

This repository simulates real-world GRC workflows using realistic documentation
and evidence-handling practices.
